# SQL Injection Attack Demonstration

- This project provides an educational demonstration of SQL injection attacks performed through form or input fields in PHP on MySQL databases. The goal of this demonstration is to showcase the potential security vulnerabilities that can arise from improper handling of user inputs in web applications.

## Project Overview

- The SQL Injection Attack Demonstration project is designed to help individuals understand the risks associated with SQL injection vulnerabilities. By simulating how attackers can exploit insecure input handling, this project aims to raise awareness about the importance of implementing proper security practices to prevent such attacks.

## Purpose and Responsibility
- The SQL Injection Attack Demonstration is intended for educational purposes only. It aims to illustrate the dangers of improper input validation and handling in web applications. Users are strongly advised not to use this demonstration for malicious purposes. Ethical use of this content is essential, and it should serve as a way to learn how to protect against real-world vulnerabilities.
